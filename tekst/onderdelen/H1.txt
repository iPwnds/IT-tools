ticketmaster: achtergrondinformatie 

- is geen monopolie (heeft geen competitors)
  maar een oligopolie (competitors niet sterk genoeg)

- waarvan komt hun grote macht

The term monopoly is employed when describing a company that has exclusive control of a market.
This means that there will only be a single seller for a certain type of product or service.
Businesses like these make it almost impossible for smaller companies to compete,
limiting the diversity in their respective market, and often raising the prices that consumers must pay.

-taylor swift: 

Recently, a spike in anti-Ticketmaster sentiments was caused by the sale for superstar 
Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in November of 2022. The Eras tour was predicted to be one of the highest selling tours in history,
being Swift’s comeback after the 2018 Reputation world tour, the third highest grossing female tour in history.
Ticketmaster reported that over 14 million users showed up to their site on the day of the presale,
despite claiming they only released 1.5 million access codes to fans.
Fans were outraged about the long wait, glitchy system, lack of tickets and immediate rise in costs.

-ook politieke backlash: 

U.S. Representative Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez was one of the many to encourage the backlash on Ticketmaster after
the Taylor Swift ticketing fiasco, reminding her fans on Twitter “that Ticketmaster is a monopoly,
its merger with LiveNation should never have been approved, and they need to be reigned in. Break them up.”

-voornaamste reden voor backlash: hoge stijgingen in prijzen (900 naar in de tienduizenden), lange wachtrijen
