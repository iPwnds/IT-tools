A ticket system, also known as a ticketing system or helpdesk ticketing system, is a software application or platform used to manage and streamline the process of handling customer or user inquiries, issues, requests, and incidents. It is commonly used by organizations in various industries to improve their customer support, IT support, and service management processes. Here's how it works and where and for what purposes it can be used:

**How a Ticket System Works:**
1. **User Submission:** The process typically starts when a user or customer submits a request or reports an issue. This request might come in the form of an email, a web form submission, a phone call, or through other communication channels.

2. **Ticket Creation:** The ticket system automatically generates a unique identifier for each request, creating a "ticket" for that specific issue or request. This ticket contains information about the request, such as the user's contact details, a description of the problem, and any relevant attachments.

3. **Categorization:** The system allows the user or support agent to categorize the ticket based on its type, severity, department, or other relevant attributes.

4. **Assignment:** The ticket is assigned to a specific support agent or team responsible for addressing the issue. The assignment can be manual or automated based on predefined rules or criteria.

5. **Tracking and Updates:** Support agents use the ticket system to track the progress of the ticket, communicate with the user, and provide updates on the status of the request. Users may receive automated notifications when there are updates to their tickets.

6. **Resolution:** The support agent works to resolve the issue or fulfill the request, and all related information and interactions are documented within the ticket.

7. **Closure:** Once the issue is resolved or the request is fulfilled, the ticket is marked as "closed." Users may be asked to confirm that their issue is resolved and provide feedback.

8. **Reporting and Analytics:** Ticket systems often include reporting and analytics features to track performance, measure response times, and identify trends in support requests. This data can help organizations improve their support processes.

**Where and for What Ticket Systems Are Used:**
Ticket systems can be used in various domains and for different purposes, including:

1. **Customer Support:** Many businesses use ticket systems to manage customer inquiries, complaints, and support requests. It helps organize and prioritize incoming requests, ensuring timely responses and resolutions.

2. **IT Support:** IT departments within organizations use ticketing systems to handle technical support requests, such as troubleshooting hardware and software issues, resolving network problems, and managing software installations and updates.

3. **Facility Management:** Facilities and maintenance teams use ticket systems to manage work orders, track maintenance requests, and schedule repairs or improvements.

4. **Human Resources:** HR departments utilize ticketing systems for managing employee inquiries, leave requests, onboarding processes, and HR-related issues.

5. **Project Management:** Some project management tools incorporate ticketing systems to track and manage tasks, issues, and project-related communication.

6. **Complaint Handling:** Government agencies and regulatory bodies use ticket systems to handle and track consumer complaints, ensuring that they are addressed in a systematic and timely manner.

7. **Event and Service Booking:** Ticketing systems are used in the event management and service industries for booking tickets, reservations, and managing customer requests.

8. **Software Development:** Development teams use issue tracking systems, which are a specific type of ticket system, to manage and track software bugs, feature requests, and development tasks.

Ticket systems help organizations improve customer satisfaction, efficiency, and accountability by providing a structured and traceable way to handle and resolve various types of requests and issues.

ticketmaster: achtergrondinformatie 

- is geen monopolie (heeft geen competitors)
  maar een oligopolie (competitors niet sterk genoeg)

- waarvan komt hun grote macht

The term monopoly is employed when describing a company that has exclusive control of a market.
This means that there will only be a single seller for a certain type of product or service.
Businesses like these make it almost impossible for smaller companies to compete,
limiting the diversity in their respective market, and often raising the prices that consumers must pay.

-taylor swift: 

Recently, a spike in anti-Ticketmaster sentiments was caused by the sale for superstar 
Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in November of 2022. The Eras tour was predicted to be one of the highest selling tours in history,
being Swift’s comeback after the 2018 Reputation world tour, the third highest grossing female tour in history.
Ticketmaster reported that over 14 million users showed up to their site on the day of the presale,
despite claiming they only released 1.5 million access codes to fans.
Fans were outraged about the long wait, glitchy system, lack of tickets and immediate rise in costs.

-ook politieke backlash: 

U.S. Representative Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez was one of the many to encourage the backlash on Ticketmaster after
the Taylor Swift ticketing fiasco, reminding her fans on Twitter “that Ticketmaster is a monopoly,
its merger with LiveNation should never have been approved, and they need to be reigned in. Break them up.”
