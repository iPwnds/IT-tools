For this reason, recent research has comprehensively explored mechanisms for managing the performance of these applications, with special focus on dealing with overload situations and providing QoS guarantees to clients. This paper makes a survey on the different proposals in the literature for managing Internet applications' performance. We present a complete taxonomy that characterizes and classifies these proposals into several categories including request scheduling, admission control, service differentiation, dynamic resource management, service degradation, control theoretic approaches, works using queuing models, observation-based approaches that use runtime measurements, and overall approaches combining several mechanisms. For each work, we provide a brief description in order to provide the reader with a global understanding of the research progress in this area. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Uncontrolled overload can lead e-commerce applications to considerable revenue losses. For this reason, overload prevention in these applications is a critical issue. In this paper we present a complete characterization of secure e-commerce applications scalability to determine which are the bottlenecks in their performance that must be considered for an overload control strategy. With this information, we design an adaptive session-based overload control strategy based on SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connection differentiation and admission control. The SSL connection differentiation is a key factor because the cost of establishing a new SSL connection is much greater than establishing a resumed SSL connection (it reuses an existing SSL session on the server). Considering this big difference, we have implemented an admission control algorithm that prioritizes resumed SSL connections to maximize the performance in session-based environments and dynamically limits the number of new SSL connections accepted, according to the available resources and the current number of connections in the system, in order to avoid server overload. Our evaluation on a Tomcat server demonstrates the benefit of our proposal for preventing server overload.},

Various external factors are considered, including WAN delays and losses and different client behavior models. We find that performance can be dramatically improved via a kernel-level modification to the web server to change the scheduling policy at the server from the standard FAIR (processor-sharing) scheduling to SRPT (shortest-remaining-processing-time) scheduling. We find that SRPT scheduling induces no penalties. In particular, throughput is not sacrificed and requests for long files experience only negligibly higher response times under SRPT than they did under the original FAIR scheduling.},
